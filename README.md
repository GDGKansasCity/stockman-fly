Project Stockman-Fly
============
A simple Google Chrome extension that adds the GDG Boomerang logo to the omnibox next to the bookmark star when a user navigates to a page where we have hidden an Easter Egg!

To manually install the Google Chrome extension:
* Download and Unzip the contents to a new folder
* Open Chrome, in a new tab type: chrome://extensions
* Check the "Developer mode" checkbox
* Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button
* Navigate to the new folder you created & select it (the folder only)
* Click "Open"/"Ok"

This makes use of the following Chrome Extension APIs:
* [chrome.declarativeContent]
* [chrome.pageAction]
* [chrome.tabs]
* [chrome.runtime]

Also in keeping with our TMNT project themes, here is the reference to how we came up with [Stockman-Fly].
